# PFAS-LEACH-Numerical-1D
PFAS-LEACH-Numerical-1D is the Tier 2 model of PFAS-LEACH. The Tier 2 model (PFAS-LEACH-1D-Numerical) is a one-dimensional numerical model for simulating variably saturated water flow and contaminant fate and transport in porous media, with a primary focus on PFAS leaching in the vadose zone and its potential impacts on underlying groundwater.

# Acknowledgment
The PFAS-LEACH Tier 2 model (PFAS-LEACH-Numerical-1D) was developed from scratch at the University of Arizona by Jicai Zeng and Bo Guo. The development of this model was supported by the Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) under Project ER21-5041.

We thank Mark L. Brusseau for helpful discussions related to the parameterization of the model as well as model validation by unsaturated miscible-displacement experiments. We also acknowledge constructive feedback from the community during the course of model development.
