# PFAS-LEACH-Numerical-1D
PFAS-LEACH-Numerical-1D is the Tier 2 model of PFAS-LEACH. The Tier 2 model (PFAS-LEACH-1D-Numerical) is a one-dimensional numerical model for simulating variably saturated water flow and contaminant fate and transport in porous media, with a primary focus on PFAS leaching in the vadose zone and its potential impacts on underlying groundwater.
